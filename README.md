

Welcome to my project ðŸŽ‰

This README file is here to give you all the information you need to get started with the project and make the most out of it.

First things first,
let's talk about what our project does ðŸ¤”

My project is  An image search engine using the Unsplash API allows users to search for and retrieve images from the Unsplash library. 
UNSPLASH API allows developers to access and use the images in their own applications, websites, or projects. 
Users can search for images using keywords
The API allows for the retrieval of information about the images, such as the photographer's name and the location the photo was taken. 
It's designed to be user-friendly and efficient.

I have worked hard to make this project as awesome as possible, and I hope you enjoy using it as much as i enjoyed building it!

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
